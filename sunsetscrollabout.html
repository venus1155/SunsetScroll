			<p>This is a tribute to sunsets and gradients, two of my favourite things.

				I wanted to see how a digital screen could mimic the calmness of sunsets and play around with making css gradients based off of images I took, which will be incorporated into the site later but for now enjoy this background image I took at home, and the background image on the credits page which I took during my 2023 birthday trip, these are two of my favourite sunsets.
